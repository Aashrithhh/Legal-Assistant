Subject : Regarding the incident on June 2

Arvind,

I've come across evidence that implicates you in the theft that occurred on June 2. I must admit I'm disappointed. However, I see the value you bring to this company, and I'm willing to overlook this incident under certain conditions.

First, you must not reach out to any reporters regarding our operations. Second, continue to work diligently and calmly without stirring up any trouble. In return, I'm offering you twice your current salary to keep things running smoothly.

Take some time to think about this offer and let me know your decision.

Best regards,

William Davis
Director of Operations
BigThorium
