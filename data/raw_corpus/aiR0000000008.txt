Subject : New job responsibilities!


Hi Sam,

I hope you are doing well. I was wondering if I could talk to you about my current job responsibilities. I know that you have been with the company for a while and have gone through the same process. Recently, I was asked to take on work that is outside of my skill set. Have you ever had to deal with that before, and if so, how did you handle it? 

Thanks,
Arvind Patel

Hi Arvind, 

I'm doing fine, thanks for asking. I'm sorry to hear that you are going through something like that. What new responsibilities were you assigned? If it's something you don't think you can handle, you should let your supervisor know as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you think you could learn and grow from this experience, I hope you take the opportunity to do so. And to answer your question, yes, it has happened to me before. I was assigned a project in marketing, which was not in my expertise. However, I approached it as an opportunity to learn and gain a new skill set. It ended up working out well for me in the end. 

Let me know if you need any help or advice. 

Best, 
Samuel Jenkins
