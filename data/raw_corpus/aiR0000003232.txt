Subject : Worker Complaints - Potential Issues

Frank,

I'm hearing more and more complaints from the construction workers about the long hours they have to put in. I'm concerned they might think about leaving the company at this rate. What are your thoughts on this? 

Best,
Bill

Bill,

There is no need to worry. These workers are here without papers and have very limited options. They're not in a position to simply leave, as it would cause them a great deal of trouble. We can continue to capitalize on their situation and keep our operations running smoothly. Let's just ensure they are not too vocal about their issues.

Frank
