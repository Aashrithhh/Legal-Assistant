Hi Vinod and Sunil,

I hope you both are keeping good! As you both have been instrumental in the construction of the new power plant, I wanted to check with you both to make sure that all health and safety protocols are being followed appropriately. If there is anything that you both think is required to be updated or changed, please let me know.

Thanks,
