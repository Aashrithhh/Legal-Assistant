Hi David and Arvind,

Thanks for sending this reminder email. Yes, we are all set to meet at the power plant site next week. Arvind, please bring the latest drawings and plans so we can review them together.

On another note, I wanted to share some personal news with you both. I am four months pregnant and just found out yesterday that we are having a girl.  :)

Best,
