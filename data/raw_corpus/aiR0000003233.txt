Subject : Housing for International Workers

Frank,

We need to discuss temporary housing for our international workers, who will be coming soon. It seems that we'll need to build facilities to accommodate them. Can you confirm this?

Also, I'm concerned about the costs associated with this endeavor. Most of our workforce are locals and don't need housing. How can we ensure that the barracks for the international workers are built at minimal costs?

Hi Bill

Yes, we will be building a series of buildings and barracks to house all workers on the project, as they are essential for achieving our goals. As for minimizing costs for the international workers' barracks, I suggest using basic materials and simplified designs. Additionally, let's prioritize assigning the budget we have for more critical components of the project.

We'll make it work without compromising our overall budget. Let's discuss these plans further next week.

Cheers,
Frank
