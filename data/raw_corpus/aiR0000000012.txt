Subject : Possible Lab Supplies Supplier

Dear Victor and Sophia,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to you today regarding lab supplies. Specifically, I have found a new supplier that I believe could be a good match for our needs.

Since it is important that we remain within our budget for the power plant project, I would like your thoughts on the matter. The new supplier offers free delivery and appears to have lower prices than our current supplier.

Could you please take a look at the attached quote from the supplier and let me know what you think? 

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Muhammad Kumar
