Subject : Need for more workers

Hi Muhammad and Samantha,

We are behind schedule and the power plant project is not progressing as expected. We need more workers to complete the welding work on time. Can we schedule a meeting to discuss the possibility of inviting more workers to join our team immediately?

Thanks,
Prakash Rangan
