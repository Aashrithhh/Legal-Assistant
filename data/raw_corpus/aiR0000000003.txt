Dear Arvind,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to reach out to you to see if we could discuss the renewable and energy efficiency possibilities for our power plant project. Do you have the time to come in and chat or even respond here?

Best,

Dear Kishore,

I agree that the energy efficiency prospects of our power plant project may have been overlooked and warrant further discussion. 

I am available to talk further today at 3:00 p.m. EST. Should we discuss in person or virtually? 

Best,
Arvind Patel
