Subject : New method for welding the pipes

Dear Arvind,

I hope you are doing well. As we are approaching the final stages of constructing the power plant and given your job, I wanted to share with you a new technique I came across last week for welding the pipes. 

A friend of mine in the industry swears by it, and I thought it would be worth exploring as it may save us some time and increase the efficiency of welding. Could you take a look at the attached document and let me know what you think? 

Best regards,
