Subject : Status update on the latest progress report

Dear Sandra Myers and Alexander Hill,

I am writing to you to provide an update on the latest progress report we received. It's important to note that there have been some issues that have arisen in regards to the welding process. We have identified some inaccuracies and have corrected them, but we believe that these errors may have been putting the project behind schedule. 

We have applied for some additional funding to cover the charges related to these unforeseen setbacks. The impact on our timeline has been minimal, and we do not believe that this will cause any substantial delays, nor will it affect our final delivery date.

We will keep you both updated in regards to our project status, and appreciate your cooperation and support in keeping the momentum going.

Best regards,

Arvind Patel, Welder/Fitter/Fabricator
