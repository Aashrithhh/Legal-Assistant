Subject : Monitoring Indian Workers' Email Communications

Frank,

I've decided to start monitoring the email communications of our Indian workers. I suspect that a few of them may be up to something that could negatively impact this project. It's important for us to keep an eye on them and nip any issues in the bud.

Please treat this information as highly confidential. Let me know if you have any concerns.

Bill,

I share your concerns and think it's a reasonable approach. However, we need to be careful not to let this information become public as it might taint our image. Let's have a meeting next week to discuss the procedures and the information we gather from this monitoring.

Best,
Frank

CEO
