Dear Rachel,

Thank you for reaching out to me on this matter. Iâ€™m happy to help.

As far as safety precautions for welding are concerned, in addition to the standard safety precautions like wearing safety glasses, gloves, etc., we should take extra measures for the welding work at a nuclear power plant. Specifically, I suggest that we take additional safety measures to protect the steel components from radiation exposure during welding.

Thank you,

Dear Arvind,

Thank you for your prompt response on this matter. Your suggestions are appreciated.

We would have to consider these suggestions seriously to avoid any possible radiation exposure. Do you have any specific recommendations on how to make this adjustment, or can we schedule a face-to-face meeting to discuss this further?
