[2017-06-15T10:01:00-05:00] Isla West Ive looked into a variety of green building materials, and I think we should focus on using bamboo for the flooring and countertops.
[2017-06-15T10:01:00-05:00] Isla West Agreed, thats why I think it would be great to have more regular check-ins during projects and after project completion to evaluate what went well and what didnt.
[2017-06-15T11:02:00-05:00] Lillian Hayes That could work, but what about the strength and durability of bamboo? Are there any concerns there?
[2017-06-15T12:01:00-05:00] Isla West Actually, bamboo is incredibly strong and durable, plus its sustainable and easily certified. I believe its a perfect choice for our project.
[2017-06-15T13:15:23-05:00] Lillian Hayes Thats a great point. Ill talk to my team and see if thats something we can implement for future projects.
[2017-06-15T16:25:04-05:00] Isla West Ok, sounds good. Let me know if theres anything my team can do to help.
[2017-06-15T17:30:12-05:00] Lillian Hayes Will do, thanks! 😊
