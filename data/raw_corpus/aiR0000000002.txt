Subject : Review of safety guidelines

Dear Oliver,

As we prepare to move towards completion of the power plant project soon, we are reviewing the safety guidelines to ensure we have covered all the necessary aspects. I would like to request a meeting to discuss the latest updates and any potential changes that we can make to strengthen the safety guidelines. Please let me know your availability at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
