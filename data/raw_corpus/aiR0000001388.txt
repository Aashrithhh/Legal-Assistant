Subject : Immediate Termination

Dear Arvind,

It has come to our attention that you were directly involved in the theft on June 2, 2017. We have conclusive proof of your actions, and as a result, we have no choice but to terminate your employment with BigThorium, effective immediately.

We have arranged for a flight to take you back to your home country at the end of the work day today. You are required to vacate the housing complex immediately.

Regards,

William Davis
Director of Operations
