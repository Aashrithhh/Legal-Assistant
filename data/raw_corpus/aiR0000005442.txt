Lillian Hayes | Isla West:
[2017-06-14T09:01:00-05:00] Isla West Agreed. Well need to do a bit of research on the best sustainable materials available on the market.
[2017-06-14T10:30:12-05:00] Isla West I completely agree. In addition, I think it would be helpful if we evaluated the site prior to starting each project and identify any potential safety concerns.
[2017-06-14T12:02:00-05:00] Lillian Hayes Yeah, Ive already started putting together some resources for us to look through. Do you have some time to sit down together and go over them?
[2017-06-14T14:03:00-05:00] Lillian Hayes Works for me! Want to meet at that one coffee shop we like at 2 pm?
[2017-06-14T14:03:00-05:00] Isla West Sure, hows next Wednesday?
[2017-06-14T14:04:00-05:00] Isla West Sounds good! Lets review the materials and coordinate design plans.
[2017-06-14T14:05:23-05:00] Lillian Hayes That sounds like a great idea. Keeping everyone safe is a priority and something we need to put more focus on.
[2017-06-14T16:15:32-05:00] Isla West Definitely. Also, I wanted to mention how much I appreciated your teams collaboration with mine during the project. Everyone was communicative and respectful of each others needs.
[2017-06-14T18:05:21-05:00] Lillian Hayes Thank you so much for sharing that feedback. Im really glad to hear that! I believe good communication and collaboration is key to project success.
