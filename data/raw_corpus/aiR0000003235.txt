Hi Frank

I wanted to give you a quick update on the housing situation. Since we separated the Indian workers' housing from the others, I've noticed an increase in agitation among them. Some are even voicing complaints about being treated unfairly.

Thank you for the update. You have my permission to increase the housing cost for the Indian workers. Inform them that due to not meeting construction deadlines on time, they will have to make up for the additional housing cost increase by having their pay docked.  Inform the workers that if they don't step up production and stop complaining they will have to return home.  Of course we know that won't happen.

Let me know if this resolves the issue.
