Subject : Issues with Welding Procedures

Hey Xavier,

I was reviewing the welding procedures for the power plant construction and I noticed some discrepancies. We need to ensure we are following all safety protocols for the welding team. Can we schedule a time to discuss this issue and provide additional training as needed?

Best,
Arvind
