Subject: Addressing the Indian Worker Situation

Francis,

We need to act quickly. The Indian workers have been discussing pay and housing again. This is becoming a pattern, and it’s creating unrest.

We can’t allow them to influence the rest of the workforce. Identify two individuals to terminate and make it clear this behavior won’t be tolerated.

We’ll justify it as a “performance concern.”

Understood. I’ll document minor infractions and proceed.

They may claim discrimination, but we’ll position it as operational necessity.

I’ll coordinate with HR to ensure the narrative is consistent.
