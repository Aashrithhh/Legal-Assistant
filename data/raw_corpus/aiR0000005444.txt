[2017-06-16T14:03:00-05:00] Lillian Hayes That sounds awesome! Lets plan on using bamboo for the flooring and countertops. Do you suggest using steel for the frame?
[2017-06-16T16:04:00-05:00] Isla West Bamboo is great for materials, but it might not work as frame material. Better we use recycled steel for the framing as its strong like bamboo and sustainable material too.
[2017-06-16T17:00:00-05:00] Lillian Hayes That sounds like a plan. Ill start looking into suppliers for the steel. Thanks, Isla!
