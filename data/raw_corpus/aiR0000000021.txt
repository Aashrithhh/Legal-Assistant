Subject : Power Plant Inspection

Dear Keith and Brijesh,

I am writing to remind you both about the upcoming inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on our new power plant. As you may already know, the inspection will be held next week to ensure that we comply with their guidelines and regulation.

Keith, can you please ensure that all the necessary documentation is prepared for the inspection and available for review by the IAEA representatives? In addition, please remind all the site workers to maintain high safety standards throughout the inspection.

Brijesh, please double-check all the welding and fabrication work to ensure we comply with IAEA guidelines. We cannot afford to have any defects that prevent us from passing the inspection.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best Regards,
Arvind Patel
Welder/Fitter/Fabricator
