Subject : Request for Revisions in Recruitment Procedures

Dear Cheryl and Laura,

I hope this email finds you both in good health and spirits. I am writing this email in request for certain revisions in our recruitment procedures. While our process has been foolproof and efficient, I think it's high time we add certain parameters that reflect our commitment towards diversity and inclusion.

In the past few weeks, the HR team has received a few complaints about our recruitment process being discriminatory. Although these complaints have been thoroughly investigated, I believe that taking proactive measures to address these complaints will help reiterate our company's ethos.

I understand that implementing these changes will require additional resources in terms of time and money, but I believe that as a company, we are committed to progressing positively and making sure that our recruitment process is inclusive for all those who plan to apply.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.

Best Regards,
Jennifer Baker
