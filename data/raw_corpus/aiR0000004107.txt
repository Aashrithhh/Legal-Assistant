William Davis | Francis Ham:
[2017-07-18T08:01:00-05:00] William Davis I want to encourage them to explore their interests first but was thinking of pushing towards something in STEM. What do you think?
[2017-07-18T09:01:00-05:00] Francis Ham I definitely support exploring interests, but some fields are more in-demand than others. What kind of STEM fields are you thinking?
[2017-07-18T11:02:00-05:00] William Davis They have an interest in biology and coding, so maybe something like bioinformatics? But theyre still young haha.
[2017-07-18T11:45:12-05:00] Francis Ham For sure. Its good to know that were on the same page when it comes to these important social issues.
[2017-07-18T11:47:18-05:00] William Davis Definitely. Its important to stay informed and engaged so we can work towards creating a better future for everyone.
[2017-07-18T11:48:57-05:00] Francis Ham So true. Anyway, gotta run to a meeting. Catch you later!
[2017-07-18T11:50:23-05:00] William Davis Take care, see you later! 👋
[2017-07-18T14:00:00-05:00] Francis Ham Its never too early to start thinking about the future 😉 Bioinformatics is a great field, and its only going to become more important.
[2017-07-18T14:01:00-05:00] Francis Ham Are you planning on encouraging them to get involved in any extracurricular activities that tie into those interests?
[2017-07-18T14:05:23-05:00] William Davis Understood, sir. Whats your suggestion on how to fire them?
[2017-07-18T14:09:18-05:00] Francis Ham I dont care, just make sure they are gone. We need to send a message to the other Indian workers that we wont tolerate any subversion.
[2017-07-18T15:45:36-05:00] William Davis Got it, sir. Ill come up with a reason to fire them. How about I blame them for the theft that occurred a while back?
[2017-07-18T15:51:12-05:00] Francis Ham Perfect. Well make an example out of them. Send the termination letters as soon as possible.
[2017-07-18T16:04:00-05:00] William Davis Definitely! I was thinking of looking into a robotics club for them to join.
[2017-07-18T17:00:00-05:00] Francis Ham Nice! Robotics can definitely be useful in bioinformatics too. Gotta get them started on the path to success early 😎
