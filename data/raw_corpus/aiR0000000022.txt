Subject : Changes to power plant construction

Dear Ava and Alexander,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you of some changes that need to be made to our project plan for the power plant construction. Specifically, we need to update our welding and fabrication procedures to meet the latest regulatory requirements. 

As our resident Welder/Fitter/Fabricator, Muhammad, would you be able to provide us with some information on the latest welding techniques that we need to incorporate into our project plan? Ava, as our Associate Electrical Engineer, could you provide us with an updated timeline for implementing these changes? Alexander, as our Lead Electrical Engineer, could you confirm that these changes will have no impact on the power plant's overall electrical systems?

Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter.

Best regards,
Muhammad Kumar
