Subject: Your Employment Status

Arvind,

I’m aware you’ve been asking questions about compensation and residency. I want to remind you that your continued employment — and your stay in this country — depend on cooperation.

If you focus on your work and avoid unnecessary discussions, we can continue as planned. Otherwise, options become limited.

— William
