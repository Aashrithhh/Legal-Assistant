Dear Liam,

I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to check in and see how the progress of the power plant is moving along. As a recruiter, I am not always privy to the details of the technical aspects of the project. However, I noticed that there was some discussion among the team regarding the selection of the equipment supplier. Is this still causing any delays or concerns that I should be aware of? 

Best regards,

Samantha Jones
Recruiter
