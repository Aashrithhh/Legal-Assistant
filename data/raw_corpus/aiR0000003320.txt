Dear Samantha,

I hope this email finds you well. We need skilled welders, fitters, and fabricators to join our team, and we'd like your assistance in finding qualified candidates in India. We're also offering these workers the opportunity to obtain a green card and become permanent residents of the United States. Can you help us find the right people?

Best regards,
