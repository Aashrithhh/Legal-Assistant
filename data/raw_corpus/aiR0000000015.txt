Subject : Safety Training Requirements

Dear Prakash and Noah,

I hope this email finds you well. I have been going through some regulatory requirements for our new power plant project, and it seems that there are some additional safety training requirements that we may need to implement.

Prakash, could you please provide me with a breakdown of our current safety training program for welders? I want to make sure we are meeting all the relevant requirements.

Noah, as an electrical engineer, do you have any experience in developing and implementing safety training programs? If so, I would appreciate your input on what we should include in our new program.

Thank you both for your help on this matter.

Best regards,
Samantha Jones
