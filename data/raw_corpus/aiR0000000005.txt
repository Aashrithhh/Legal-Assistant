Subject : Update on Power Plant Construction Schedule

Dear Samantha and Muhammad,

I wanted to provide you both with an update on the construction schedule for the power plant project. We have encountered some delays due to unforeseen circumstances, including issues with our suppliers and with regulatory and licensing requirements. However, we have been working closely with the necessary authorities to address these issues and are confident that we will be back on track soon.

Muhammad, how are things progressing on your end with the welding and fitting work? Please let me know if you need any additional resources or support from our team.

Samantha, I wanted to check in with you regarding recruitment. Have we been able to fill all of the open positions for the project? If not, please let me know how else we can improve our recruitment efforts.

Thank you both for your hard work and dedication to this project.

Best regards,

Scarlett Reed
Associate Project Manager
