Subject : Our situation

Mo,

We need to talk about these pay cuts and what about the fake promises?  No way they are getting us citizenship anytime now.  We need to help our family back home asap.

What if we write to a local newspaper anonymously? Maybe they will bring our pay back up? 

meet me outside now.
