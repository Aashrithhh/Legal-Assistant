Subject : Renewable energy and energy efficiency considerations

Dear Samantha,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the renewable energy and energy efficiency considerations for the power plant project we are working on. I think it would be great to have some of these prominently featured in the upcoming town hall meeting. As a recruiter, you would have your finger on the pulse of what the residents of the town care about most. Do any specific renewable energy or energy efficiency strategies that we could use to make the plant more efficient come to mind? 

All the best,
Scarlett Reed
Associate Project Manager
