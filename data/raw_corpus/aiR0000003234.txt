Subject : Security Concern: Theft in Housing Complex

Frank,

I wanted to bring to your attention that there was a theft in the housing complex during business hours. We have video evidence of the incident, but the culprits are not properly identifiable. I've been observing some of the Indian workers trying to unionize and influence other workers, and they come off more like a gang than an organized labor group.

I think it's best for the safety of everyone that for now we segregate the international housing. We should keep the Indian workers in Complex A and move all other workers to Complexes B and C. This will ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

Please advise on how to proceed,
Bill

Bill,

Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. The safety of our employees is a top priority, and it's essential that we maintain a secure work environment.

Your suggestion to segregate the housing complexes seems like a prudent measure in light of the current situation. Please ensure that the Indian workers are relocated to Complex A and the other workers to Complexes B and C as soon as possible.

Additionally, let's work on enhancing security measures in the housing complexes to prevent future thefts and keep a close eye on any suspicious activities.
